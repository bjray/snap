Among the many awesome contributors, there are the maintainers. These maintainers may change over time, but they are all members of the @intelsdi-x/snap-maintainers team.

### Responsibilities of Maintainers
Maintainers are expected to contribute regularly in at least one of the following capacities:
* Direction/Design: Meaningfully contributing to RFC or design comments
* Code Contributions: Submitting pull requests for either bug fixes or features
* Support: Active participation in a support role in some form (code reviews, addressing questions, triaging issues)

If a maintainer is consistently unable to perform the above actions they will be asked to withdraw from the maintainer group. This does not preclude them from becoming a maintainer at a later date.

### Initial Authors
All contributors are equally important to us, but we would like to thank the [initial authors](AUTHORS.md#initial-authors) for helping make open sourcing Snap possible.
